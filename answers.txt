Sorry if my answer for question 3 looks strange.  I felt the meaning of least expensive was somewhat open to interpretation (sum of spend vs sum of CPV, etc) so I took an educated guess.



Unique campaigns which occurred in February: 125

Total conversions on plant initiatives: 299519

The audience|asset combination with the least expensive average cost is: mountains_cow
*Assuming "least expensive" refers to the average value of (CPM || CPV)/(total conversions for this campaign instance) for each combination*

The average cost per video was view: 0.546782834117
